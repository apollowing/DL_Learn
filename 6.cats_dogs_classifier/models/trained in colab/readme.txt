This experiment is done on Google colab on 12 April 24.
The keras file is the model trained from transfer learning and it performs exceptionally well.
Unfortunately, I did not save the model file from the CNN learning that I tried training from scratch.
Both models are trained for 20 epochs, and we can see the power of transfer learning.
Run tensorboard against the log folder (extract from zip file).
